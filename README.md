# DisFabric

#### Fabric <> Discord bridge

### Extremely Important - Before trying to build this branch

The 1.16.5 version of DisFabric requires this edit of fabric-loom, https://github.com/irunatbullets/fabric-loom/tree/aof3/0.7. Once you have your copy of it, run `gradle publishToMavenLocal -x test`. You should then be able to build DisFabric without an issues.

Oh, and make sure you're using Java 8!
